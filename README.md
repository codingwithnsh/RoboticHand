# 🤖 Voice-Controlled Robotic Hand

The **Voice-Controlled Robotic Hand** is a functional robotic prototype that responds to user voice commands to simulate various hand movements. Built using microcontroller-based hardware, servo motors, and speech recognition software, it demonstrates the integration of mechanical systems with artificial intelligence.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Due to security reasons involving proprietary APIs and machine learning services, the source code is not shared in this repository.

## 🔧 Features

- Accepts voice commands such as "open hand", "close hand", "point", and more
- Real-time motion response using servo motors
- Customizable gestures and command mapping
- Ideal for learning robotics, assistive technology, and embedded systems

## 📦 Hardware Used

- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Uno/Nano or Raspberry Pi)
- Servo Motors (x5 for each finger)
- Voice Recognition Module / Bluetooth-connected Android device
- Mechanical hand frame (3D printed or built with hobby materials)
- Power Supply (Battery or USB)

## 🛠️ Software Used

- Arduino IDE / Python for microcontroller programming
- Voice recognition app or software (e.g., Android SpeechRecognizer API)
- Serial/Bluetooth communication protocols

## 🚀 How It Works
  
1. The user speaks a command (e.g., "close hand").
2. The system processes the speech and sends the corresponding signal to the microcontroller.
3. The microcontroller activates specific servo motors to perform the desired motion.
