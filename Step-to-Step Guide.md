# üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Guide: Voice-Controlled Robotic Hand

This guide outlines how to build a voice-controlled robotic hand. While the code is not included for security reasons (due to use of ML and APIs), this walkthrough provides all necessary steps to implement the project yourself.

## üìç Step 1: Choose or Build a Robotic Hand Frame

### Option A: Build Your Own
- Sketch or 3D model a human hand.
- Use cardboard, acrylic, or 3D printing to create the hand.
- Attach servo motors to control finger movement.

### Option B: Use a Smartivity Robotic Hand Kit
- Buy the [Smartivity Robotic Hand](https://www.smartivity.in/products/smartivity-robotic-hand) kit.
- Alternatively, get it on [Amazon India](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B08B5SWS1M).
- Assemble the hand **as per the included manual**.
- **Remove the finger-pulling string mechanism**, and replace it by connecting a **servo motor** to each finger joint for motorized control.

## üìç Step 2: Choose Your Microcontroller

- Use an **Arduino Uno/Nano** or a **Raspberry Pi**.
- Set up the IDE (Arduino IDE for Arduino, or Python for Raspberry Pi).

---

## üìç Step 3: Set Up Voice Recognition

- **Option A (Hardware Module):**
  - Use a voice recognition module like **Elechouse V3** connected directly to the microcontroller.

- **Option B (Bluetooth Method):**
  - Use an Android device with built-in speech recognition.
  - Transmit commands over Bluetooth using apps like *MIT App Inventor* or *Serial Bluetooth Terminal*.

## üìç Step 4: Map Commands to Gestures

- Create a list of gestures and their corresponding voice commands.
- For each gesture, define the required angles of servo rotation.

---

## üìç Step 5: Wiring and Assembly

- Connect servo motors to PWM-capable pins on the microcontroller.
- Provide a **stable 5V power supply** for the servos (USB power may not be enough).
- Ensure all wiring is neat and safely connected.

---

## üìç Step 6: Program the Microcontroller

- Write logic to:
  - Receive and interpret the voice command.
  - Control the servos to perform the gesture.
- Ensure you handle timing, positioning, and safety logic in the code.

---

## üìç Step 7: Test and Calibrate

- Speak commands and observe hand movements.
- Adjust servo angles as needed for more natural movement.
- Add debug logs or LED indicators for better troubleshooting.

---

## üìç Step 8: Finalize

- Mount the electronics in a safe enclosure or wearable glove.
- Label commands or use colored wires for clarity.
- Optionally enhance the design for presentation/demo purposes.

---

## ‚úÖ Tips

- Use a breadboard for initial tests.
- Include fail-safes in code for unexpected input.
- Be careful with power ‚Äî servos can drain batteries quickly.
